# PenPal reLOADED

PenPal reLOADED is a new twist on an old concept. Unlike other pen pal approaches, we allow you to connect with people who have similar interests and tastes that allow you to expand your communication outside of your normal friend circle and learn more about the world around you. 


## FULL STACK WEB FINAL ASSISNGMENT
At the beginning of the semester, I had hoped to have a fully accessible page. Despite some snafus, I believe the overall product is decent regards the conceptualization I had for this assignment. The goal was supposed to be a site that allowed people (pen pals), to share their intersts and possiby find new things to intrigue them. I had hoped to have the profile pages that I created work, but that seems to be far out of my knowledge base. Overall, by visiting my site, you can look at interests like arts and crafts, reading, sports, etc. The target audience is for individuals 18 or above.

### API Method 1

   User can post additional intersts to each MVC page.

#### Parameters

The tags I used most in this assignment (besides the necessary ones (e.g. <html></html>), inluded <iframe>, <img src = "#">, <a href="#", and <font color="white">. 


#### Errors

I ran into a lot of errors and mishaps while accomplishing this assignment. It seemed as though every time I attempted to implement a new attribute I ended up with the dreaded whitelabel internal error. Despite these adversities, the current issues that the site currently has includes the about.html not being able to be updated, artscrafts.html not allowing me to post, and the profile page not loading. Aside from that there are various pages that are working and my Travis CI build is still passing. 

## Technologies Used

- [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) - Takes an opinionated view of building production-ready Spring applications.
- [Codenvy](https://codenvy.io)
- [Bootstrap via W3C](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_grid_examples.asp) - While I was researching tags and additional components I wanted to try for this assignment, the W3C has some bootstrap capabilties that I tried to incorporate (without actually trying to use bootstrap).
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool.
- [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com) - hosting my application
